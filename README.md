StreamSDR is a free, open source and cross-platform streaming server for software defined radios. It aims to be device and platform agnostic, allowing a wide range of SDR's and client applications to be used with each other, both locally and over the network.

It can be used by SDR client applications that are able to connect to remote servers using the [rtl_tcp](https://osmocom.org/projects/rtl-sdr/wiki) protocol.

StreamSDR is developed by [Orry Verducci](https://orryverducci.co.uk/).
